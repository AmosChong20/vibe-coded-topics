# Product Spec: ProtoPlay

**Inspired By:** Figma

**Core Feature:** A collaborative wireframing tool. Users can draw simple shapes and layouts for a website or app on a shared canvas. Multiple users can design at the same time to quickly prototype ideas together.

## User Interaction

**Collaborative Designer:**
*   **Create New Canvas:** Starts a new blank wireframing project.
*   **Invite Collaborators:** Shares a link to allow others to join and edit the same canvas.
*   **Draw Shapes/Elements:** Selects basic UI elements (rectangles for buttons, text boxes for labels) from a toolbar and draws them on the canvas.
*   **Real-time Editing:** Sees other collaborators' cursors and changes appear instantly on the shared canvas.
