# Product Spec: Task Tiles

**Inspired By:** Trello

**Core Feature:** A visual project board using cards and columns. Users can create a board, add columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done"), and create "task tiles" that they can drag and drop between columns to track their progress.

## User Interaction

**Project Manager/Individual User:**
*   **Create Board:** Initiates a new project board.
*   **Add Column:** Creates new columns to represent different stages of a workflow.
*   **Create Task Tile:** Adds a new task card to a column, giving it a title and description.
*   **Drag & Drop Tile:** Moves task tiles between columns to update their status (e.g., from "To Do" to "In Progress").
