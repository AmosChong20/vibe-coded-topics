# Product Spec: IdeaBox

**Inspired By:** Notion

**Core Feature:** A flexible note-taking app using blocks. Users can create a page and add different "blocks" of content, such as text, to-do lists, or bullet points, to create simple, structured notes for personal or project use.

## User Interaction

**Note Taker:**
*   **Create Page:** Starts a new blank page for notes.
*   **Add Block:** Clicks an "+" icon or similar to add a new content block (e.g., text, heading, to-do, bullet list).
*   **Edit Block:** Types directly into text blocks, checks off to-do items, etc.
*   **Rearrange Blocks:** Drags and drops blocks to reorder content on the page.
